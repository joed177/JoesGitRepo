Creating your first Repository

Create a local directory where you want your repository to exist.  This folder will be the repository.  
You can put the files you want to track into this folder before or after creating the repository.
The command:
	git init		# create the repository

Will create the repository, effectively creating a subfolder called .git.  This folder will hold all the 
SCCS tracking information.  Before doing anything else with this folder create a file called .gitignore, 
using any editor in the root of the repository.  To this file add *.log to ignore log files.
Add a new line **/logs 		# if you have a folder that contains log files

Save the file.

Before proceeding we must commit this .gitignore file.
Git status will show that the .gitignore exists in you repository but is not being tracked.

	Git add .gitignore 	#adds the file to be committed (ie staged)
	Git commit

The editor you chose will pop up allowing you to indicated what change was made.  You must add an explanation of
what was changed / added.  If you don’t explain the change, the commit will be aborted.  The commit message 
is important and should explain what is changing clearly.

To commit another file:
	Git add filename 		# adds one file
	Git add . 			# adds all files
	Git commit -m “short message”		# a shortcut that doesn’t open a notepad file
	Git log 		# shows what branch you are on and where you are in the SCCS (HEAD) normally 
				# at the end of the chain
