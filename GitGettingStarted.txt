I always thought about Git and GitHub as the same thing.  In fact, they are separate things.  
There are also GUIs that allow you to manage the remote repositories.While Git is the language of source code 
control, GitHub is a web-based repository storage solution.  You don’t have to store repositories on GitHub, 
and there are competitors.  GitHub was the first and remains the most popular.

When you create a shared repository, you normally start at the remote host such as GitHub.com, but while we
are learning git, we will start on the local machine.  Later we'll create an empty repository on GitHub, download
it to the local machine, add stuff and push it back to the remote host, but for now, we'll concentrate on the
local machine

A repository is just a folder where files are stored.  The files don’t have to be code files, they can be text 
files or anything else.  For this discussion we’ll stick to software and text.  Files like word documents can also
be tracked, but only at the file level.  Text and software files (which are basically text files) can be tracked
to the line changed.

Putting a bunch of files in a folder, doesn’t make it a repository.  The repository must be created.  
We'll start a new repository on your local machine.  Git can manage a repository stored anywhere, including the 
local machine.Before starting download Windows Terminal if you don’t already have it.  
Then go to www.git-scm.com and download a copy of Git.
